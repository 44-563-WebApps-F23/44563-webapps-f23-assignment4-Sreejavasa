<h6>REGINA.</h6> 
<p>[In a low voice.]</p>
<p>What do you want? Stop where you are. You're</p>
<p>positively dripping.</p>

<h6>ENGSTRAND.</h6> 
<p>It's the Lord's own rain, my girl.</p>

<h6>REGINA.</h6>
<p>It's the devil's rain, _I_ say.</p>

<h6>ENGSTRAND.</h6> 
<p>Lord, how you talk, Regina.</p> 
<p>[Limps a step or two forward intothe room.]</p>
 <p>It's just this as I wanted to say--</p>

<h6>REGINA.</h6> 
<p>Don't clatter so with that foot of yours, I tell you! The young</p>
<p>master's asleep upstairs.</p>

<h6>ENGSTRAND.</h6> 
<p>Asleep? In the middle of the day?</p>

<h6>REGINA.</h6> 
<p>It's no business of yours.</p>

<h6>ENGSTRAND.</h6>

<h6>REGINA.</h6>

<h6>REGINA.</h6>

<h6>ENGSTRAND.</h6>
<p>--and temptations are manifold in this world, you see. </p> 
<p>But all the same, I was hard at work, God knows, at half-past five this morning.</p>

<h6>REGINA.</h6>
 <p>Very well; only be off now. I won't stop here and have_rendezvous's_</p>
 <p>[Note: This and other French words by Regina are in that language in the original] with you.</p>
 
 <h6>ENGSTRAND.</h6> 
 <p>What do you say you won't have?</p>
