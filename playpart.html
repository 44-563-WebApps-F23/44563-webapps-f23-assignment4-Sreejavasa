    [ENGSTRAND, the carpenter, stands by the garden door. His left leg
is somewhat bent; he has a clump of wood under the sole of his boot.
REGINA, with an empty garden syringe in her hand, hinders him from
advancing.]

REGINA. 
[In a low voice.] 
What do you want? Stop where you are. You're
positively dripping.

ENGSTRAND. 
It's the Lord's own rain, my girl.

REGINA. 
It's the devil's rain, _I_ say.

ENGSTRAND. 
Lord, how you talk, Regina. [Limps a step or two forward into
the room.] It's just this as I wanted to say--

REGINA. 
Don't clatter so with that foot of yours, I tell you! The young
master's asleep upstairs.

ENGSTRAND. 
Asleep? In the middle of the day?

REGINA. 
It's no business of yours.

ENGSTRAND. 
I was out on the loose last night--

REGINA. 
I can quite believe that.

ENGSTRAND. 
Yes, we're weak vessels, we poor mortals, my girl--

REGINA. 
So it seems.

ENGSTRAND.
--and temptations are manifold in this world, you see. But all
the same, I was hard at work, God knows, at half-past five this morning.

REGINA.
 Very well; only be off now. I won't stop here and have
_rendezvous's_ [Note: This and other French words by Regina are in that
language in the original] with you.
